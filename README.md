This was supposed to be my tictactoe python game, but I have been named to be the closest relative to my friend that has been in intensive care since September 11. She died yesterday and I have had too much on my plate to manage this week's assignments on top of everything. So sorry, but I am not ready to quit, I just need some time to get myself together.
